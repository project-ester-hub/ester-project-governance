# ESTER Code of Conduct

The code of conduct for the ESTER research group at the University of Kiel.

This document serves as a guiding framework for our group, fostering a respectful, inclusive, and productive research environment within the ESTER project.

## Our Mission

- We aim to develop advanced computational models and archaeological datasets to reconstruct population dynamics across Europe and Western Asia over the past 12,000 years.
- Our research integrates prehistoric archaeology, paleoenvironmental science, and computational modeling.
- We are committed to Open Science and fostering a collaborative research environment.
- Our project emphasizes **adaptive research methodologies**, promoting flexibility and responsiveness to new insights.

## Our Principles

- We strive for a lasting impact on our scientific field and society, building on and contributing to the research community.
- Our research is transparent, reproducible, and openly available whenever possible.
- We support ethical research practices and endorse principles of scientific integrity.
- We encourage **iterative refinement** of our methods and approaches to enhance research outcomes.

## Communication

- **Be respectful** in all interactions.
- **Acknowledge contributions** appropriately, including co-authorship where warranted.
- **Provide constructive feedback**, ensuring clarity, conciseness, and relevance.
- **Encourage regular check-ins** to align goals and facilitate knowledge exchange.

## Work-Life Balance

- We encourage a sustainable work-life balance to support creativity and productivity.
- Flexible working arrangements are supported, respecting availability hours and personal commitments.
- Academic work is based on trust, and we focus on outcomes rather than rigid schedules.
- **Regularly assessing and adjusting workloads** helps maintain an effective work rhythm.

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

- We value diversity in perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences.
- Discrimination, harassment, or prejudice of any form is not tolerated.
- Open discussions about cultural differences are encouraged to foster an inclusive environment.

## Conflict Resolution and Well-being

- Personal concerns and conflicts should be addressed through open discussions.
- University of Kiel provides support services for mental health and professional development.
- Individuals should feel comfortable seeking advice and support within the group.

## Supervision, Mentoring, and Responsibilities

- Regular one-on-one meetings support academic and professional growth.
- Guidance is provided for career development, including fellowship applications and job opportunities.
- Co-supervision arrangements should be clarified early, ensuring clear expectations.
- **Regular feedback loops** allow for adjustments and continuous learning.

## Research Integrity

- Our research follows high ethical and scientific standards, ensuring reproducibility and transparency.
- Proper documentation, version control (e.g., GitHub), and structured workflows are essential.
- All data and publications should be cited appropriately and follow licensing agreements.
- **A structured approach to research development** ensures accountability and continuous improvement.

## Publishing and Authorship

- Authorship should be based on significant intellectual contributions.
- Decisions on author lists should be made collaboratively and transparently.
- Pre-publication repositories (e.g., Open Science Framework, Zenodo) are encouraged.
- **Engaging with the research community early** enhances collaboration and knowledge exchange.

## Code and Data Management

- All code and datasets should be version-controlled and, when possible, publicly accessible.
- Reproducibility is keyâ€”document workflows and provide necessary metadata.
- Prior to submission, repositories should be reviewed for completeness and clarity.
- **Incremental improvements to code and workflows** support collaborative development.

## Group Meetings

- Bi-weekly group meetings foster collaboration and knowledge exchange.
- Discussions include research progress, challenges, and goal setting.
- Special meetings may be scheduled before major conferences.
- **Regular reflection on processes** ensures effective project coordination.

## Conferences and Collaborations

- Group members are encouraged to present their work at international conferences.
- Collaborative research efforts should be openly discussed and managed effectively.
- Co-authorship and contributions should be transparently communicated.

## Acknowledgements and Affiliations

- Publications should include relevant affiliations and funding acknowledgements.
- Proper citation and attribution of software, data, and prior research are expected.

## Onboarding and Offboarding

- New members receive guidance on research tools, expectations, and best practices.
- Departing members should ensure that datasets, code, and documents are well-documented for continuity.
